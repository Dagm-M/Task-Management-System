# Task Management System

This project is a Task Management System built using ASP.NET Core with PostgreSQL for the database. It follows the principles of Clean Architecture to organize the application's structure.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required NuGet packages:
   - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore`
   - `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`
   - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`

2. Create a PostgreSQL database named `TaskManagment`.

3. Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your PostgreSQL database.

## Back-End Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core:** Provides the foundation for your application, including routing, controllers, and services.
- **Entity Framework Core:** Handles data access and database management.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used as the relational database for storing user, task, team, and related data.

## Authentication

- **ASP.NET Core Identity:** Offers built-in authentication and authorization management, including user accounts, roles, and claims.
- **IdentityServer:** Can be implemented for Single Sign-On (SSO) or OAuth-based authentication with external applications.
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Implements secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Architecture and Patterns

- **Clean Architecture:** Organizes the application into layers following clean architecture principles to separate concerns.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes the built-in dependency injection system in ASP.NET Core to manage services and components.

## APIs and Libraries

- **ASP.NET Core Web API:** Exposes RESTful APIs for potential integration with other services or applications.
- **AutoMapper:** Facilitates mapping between data models and view models.
- **FluentValidation:** Handles validation of input data.

## Testing

- **xUnit or NUnit:** Used for unit testing.
- **Moq or equivalent:** Employed for mocking dependencies in unit tests.

## Version Control and Deployment

- **Git:** Enables version control of your code.
